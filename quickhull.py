# Quick Hull algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points - ECM3428 â€“ Algorithms that changed the world
# step 1. Find the min and max x values. forming a line segment that seperates the points into 2 subsets left and right
# step 2. for each subset, find the point that is farthest from the line segment
# step 3. repeat step 2 for the 2 new line segments
# step 4. repeat step 3 until no points are left
# step 5. terminate the algorithm
